00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.100
Well, we're going to begin.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.380
Welcome, everyone!

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.580
There's one student that we're still missing,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.680
but if she shows up, we'll add her to the end.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260
Thank you, thank you!

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.700
Your children have worked hard this yearâ€”every
one of them.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.860
I'm amazed.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.720
I just told one of my kids yesterday that
my beginner group class has emptied.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.160
They're all in the intermediate-to-book-two, now.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So, that's so encouraging!

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.580
And also the work, as you know, is thanks

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.120
to the parents, who are at home, making them practice.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.300
I want to give you a couple little details.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.260
After we're all finished there are refreshments
that you all have provided (thank you).

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.340
If you would please keep them out of the sanctuary
(the big room) that would be great.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.680
Hopefully I've set enough chairs out there,
but if you need to you can drag a chair

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.720
and have a seat in the foyer, if you would.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.240
Each student will play two pieces.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.620
And when they're finished, they don't necessarily need to return to their seats.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.220
If they need to come see their parent, that's fine. Okay?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.980
So without further ado, we're going to skip
over Miss Anya, (because she's not here today)

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.460
and Grace is going to start. Come on up, Grace!
